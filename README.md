# Euro-CleanArchitecture on Android.

Example Android Clean Architecture used to explain how to use this architecture (rules) in our android applications.
This example was created to support an article explanation that I have written about how to architect android application using the Uncle Bob's clean architecture. [Aplicando Clean Architecture en Android][1] (spanish).
